# Heart Disease Classification Project

A learning project focused on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## About

This project is designed for educational purposes to practice data analysis, visualization, and machine learning classification. It uses a heart disease dataset to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset

The project uses `heart-disease.csv` containing medical and demographic features to predict the presence of heart disease.

The original data came from the Cleveland database from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, I've downloaded it in a formatted way from Kaggle.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Data Analysis**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Development**: Jupyter Notebook

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb
```
